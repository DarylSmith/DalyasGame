Dalya's Game
###############

Dalyas' Game is a game conceived by my daughter, Dalya, where users attempt to figure out a randomly selected number based on clues provided by the computer.
The front-end is simply 1 js, 1 css and 1 html file with no additional frameworks or libraries (it does use a google font though).

The back end (logging and retrieving high scores) is a set of serverless AWS lambda functions contained in the aws-lambda folder that is connected to a dynamoDB document database
